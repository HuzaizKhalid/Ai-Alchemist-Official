### üìä Mathematical Formulas Implemented

All your specified formulas are now working:

1. **Tree Absorption**: 1 Oak tree = 4.6 tCO‚ÇÇe lifetime (23 kg/year √ó 200 years)
2. **Trees Required**: `Carbon Footprint √∑ 4.6`
3. **Offset Cost**: `Total Emissions √ó $14 USD`
4. **Daily Growth**: `0.000063 tCO‚ÇÇe √ó days`
5. **Car Equivalence**: 
   - Miles: `Carbon Footprint (kg) √∑ 0.4`
   - Kilometers: `Carbon Footprint (kg) √∑ 0.248`
6. **Net Emissions**: `Total Emissions - (User Trees √ó 4.6)`
7. **Surplus Calculation**: When net emissions < 0
