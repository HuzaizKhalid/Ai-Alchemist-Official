# ðŸš€ Live Search Suggestions - Setup Guide

## âœ… Currently Working (No Setup Required)
Your search suggestions are already powered by **live APIs**:
- **Google Suggest API** - Real Google autocomplete data
- **Wikipedia API** - Educational and factual suggestions  
- **DuckDuckGo API** - Current trends and topics

## ðŸ¤– Optional: AI-Powered Suggestions (Free)

To add **AI-powered intelligent suggestions** from Groq:

### Step 1: Get Free Groq API Key
1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/keys
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy your API key (starts with `gsk_`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment
Add this line to your `.env.local` file:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance
